        About MediTriage
        MediTriage is a simple, intelligent self-triage tool designed to help people understand their symptoms and choose the right level of care. Instead of guessing whether a condition requires home care, a clinic visit, or emergency attention, MediTriage guides users through a structured symptom check and provides clear, practical recommendations.

        Our goal is to reduce unnecessary hospital visits, save time for both patients and doctors, and make basic health guidance accessible anytime, anywhere.

        if you have a fever, cough, and body aches, MediTriage might suggest home care with rest and fluids. If you have chest pain or difficulty breathing, it would recommend seeking emergency care immediately. By providing personalized advice based on symptoms, MediTriage empowers users to make informed decisions about their health and ensures they receive the appropriate care when they need it most.
